SuperTurtle is an autonomous coding agent you control from Telegram. Send a voice message or text from your phone, and it runs [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (or [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/), beta) on your machine to write code, run tests, fix bugs, and ship features. You can be on the couch, on a walk, or on a completely different machine. For bigger tasks it spins up parallel workers called SubTurtles and supervises them to completion. You get milestone updates as things land, not a wall of logs.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g superturtle
superturtle init
superturtle start
```

For agents and CI, init runs non-interactively with flags:

```bash
superturtle init --token <BOT_TOKEN> --user <TELEGRAM_USER_ID> --openai-key <KEY>
```

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.0
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) — `brew install tmux`
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI — uses your existing subscription, no extra API keys

## Why superturtle

1. **Uses your Claude Code subscription** — no extra API-token workflow.
2. **Mobile + voice first** via Telegram.
3. **Long-running, multi-step work** — spawns parallel SubTurtles.
4. **Milestone updates** — you get progress, not noise.
5. **Works from anywhere** — phone, tablet, another machine.

## SubTurtles

SubTurtles are autonomous worker agents that run in loops. The Meta Agent spawns them for tasks, monitors progress, and reports back to you. Each SubTurtle gets its own working directory under `.subturtles/` with a task file, CLAUDE.md, and logs.

Loop types:

- **yolo** — single Claude Code call per iteration. Fast, autonomous ralph loop. The default for most tasks.
- **slow** — plan, groom, execute, review. Four agent calls per iteration. More careful, better for complex or risky work.
- **yolo-codex** — same as yolo but runs Codex instead of Claude.

## Architecture

- **Meta Agent** — the bot itself. Plans, delegates, supervises.
- **SubTurtles** — autonomous workers running in ralph loops (yolo, slow, yolo-codex).
- **MCP servers** — stickers, bot-control, ask-user (inline buttons).
- **Drivers** — Claude Code (primary), Codex (optional).

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| macOS    | Fully supported |
| Linux    | Alpha |
| Windows  | Not yet (WSL2 may work) |

**macOS note:** Enable `System Settings → Battery → Options → Prevent automatic sleeping when the display is off` when on power adapter.

## TOS compliance

Super Turtle spawns the `claude` CLI binary as a child process (`claude -p --output-format stream-json`). This is the [officially documented headless usage](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage) — the same way CI pipelines and editor extensions invoke Claude Code.

**What Super Turtle does:**
- Spawns `claude` as a subprocess with standard CLI flags
- Uses your existing CLI authentication (your logged-in session)
- Reads structured output from stdout

**What Super Turtle does NOT do:**
- Extract or reuse OAuth tokens from your keychain for model inference
- Proxy your subscription credentials to other users or services
- Use the Anthropic API or Agent SDK with subscription OAuth tokens
- Circumvent Claude Code's rate limiting or usage caps

The `/usage` bot command reads your local OAuth token solely to call Anthropic's own usage-reporting endpoint (`api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`) — the same endpoint Claude Code's built-in `/usage` displays. It is read-only and never used for model inference.

See the [full TOS compliance page](https://www.superturtle.dev/docs/config/tos-compliance) for details.

## Security

Super Turtle runs Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Every file read, file write, and shell command happens without a confirmation prompt. This is by design — confirming each action from your phone would make the tool unusable.

You should run Super Turtle in a sandboxed or dedicated environment (VM, container, separate user account) — it has full access to read, write, and execute within configured paths. Multiple defense layers (user allowlist, rate limiting, path validation, command blocking, audit logging) reduce risk, but the permission model is inherently open. Read the [full security model](https://www.superturtle.dev/docs/config/security) for threat model, incident response, and deployment checklist.
