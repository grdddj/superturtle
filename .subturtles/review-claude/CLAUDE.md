# Current task
Write final `reviews/claude-review.md` with prioritized findings across all sections.

# End goal with specs
A concise review document listing the biggest issues found across the codebase that would be straightforward to fix. Focus on:
- Bugs (logic errors, race conditions, unhandled edge cases)
- Security issues (exposed secrets, missing validation, injection risks)
- Dead code or unused imports that add confusion
- Obvious performance problems
- Error handling gaps that would cause silent failures

DO NOT fix anything. Only report findings. Each finding should include: file path, line range, what the issue is, and a one-liner on how to fix it.

Skip nitpicks, style issues, and minor refactors. Only report issues where the impact is significant and the fix is straightforward (< 30 min of work each).
