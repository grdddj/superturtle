## Current Task
Finish and verify create/edit/delete post tests in `linkedin-demo/e2e/core.spec.ts` (tests 5-6).

## End Goal with Specs
Comprehensive Playwright e2e test suite at `linkedin-demo/e2e/` that tests all core user flows against the live app at `https://linkedin-demo-iota.vercel.app`. Tests must pass reliably in CI (headless Chromium).

**Test URL:** `https://linkedin-demo-iota.vercel.app`
**Auth method:** Click "Continue as Guest" button on login page — no credentials needed.

**Test structure:**
- Config: `linkedin-demo/playwright.config.ts`
- Tests: `linkedin-demo/e2e/core.spec.ts`

**Playwright config requirements:**
- `baseURL: 'https://linkedin-demo-iota.vercel.app'`
- `testDir: './e2e'`
- Chromium only (no Firefox/WebKit for now)
- `timeout: 30000` per test
- `retries: 1`
- Screenshots on failure

**Helper pattern:** Create a shared `e2e/helpers.ts` with:
- `loginAsGuest(page)` — navigates to baseURL, clicks "Continue as Guest", waits for feed to load (wait for text "Start a post" to be visible)
- Use this in `beforeEach` for all tests

**Tests to write in `core.spec.ts`:**

1. **Guest login** — navigate to app, see login page, click "Continue as Guest", verify feed loads (post form visible, at least one post visible)

2. **Feed loads posts** — after login, verify multiple posts render with author name, timestamp, description text

3. **Like a post** — click Like button on first post, verify the Like icon turns green (#2e7d32), verify like count appears (thumbs up icon visible in stats row). Click again to unlike, verify it reverts.

4. **Comment on a post** — click Comment button, type "Test comment from e2e", submit, verify comment appears in the list with text and author name. Then delete the comment (click delete icon), verify it disappears.

5. **Create a post** — type "E2E test post" in the "Start a post" input, click Post button, verify the post appears in the feed with the correct text. Then clean up: open the 3-dot menu on the new post, click Delete.

6. **Edit a post** — create a post first, then open 3-dot menu, click Edit, change text to "Edited e2e post", click Save, verify the updated text shows. Clean up by deleting it.

7. **Tab navigation** — click "My Network" tab, verify network page loads (search field or user cards visible). Click "Messaging", verify messaging loads. Click "Notifications", verify notifications page loads. Click "Home", verify feed is back.

**Important implementation notes:**
- Install playwright as a devDependency: `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test --legacy-peer-deps`
- Install browsers: `npx playwright install chromium`
- Add `"test:e2e": "npx playwright test"` script to package.json
- All selectors should use `getByText()`, `getByRole()`, `getByPlaceholder()` — avoid fragile CSS class selectors
- Use `waitForTimeout` sparingly — prefer `waitForSelector` or Playwright auto-waiting
- Each test should be independent (login fresh via beforeEach)
- After writing tests, run them: `cd linkedin-demo && npx playwright test --reporter=list`
- Fix any failures before marking complete
- Commit all test files when done

## Backlog
- [x] Install Playwright, create config and helper files
- [x] Write auth + feed tests (tests 1-2)
- [x] Write like + comment tests (tests 3-4)
- [ ] Write create/edit/delete post tests (tests 5-6) <- current
- [ ] Write tab navigation test (test 7)
- [ ] Run full suite, fix failures, commit

Progress note: tests 5-6 were added, but verification is currently blocked by a live app runtime error (`likes:getLikeStatuses` missing in deployed Convex functions) that triggers the feed ErrorBoundary.
