# Runtime / Session Review

Ordered by severity.

## High

### 1. Resumed Codex threads are not persisted to prefs, so crash recovery can point back at the wrong session
- File paths: `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/codex-session.ts`
- Approximate lines: `939-945`, `1065-1070`, `1095-1109`
- Issue: `CodexSession` reloads `prefs.threadId` on startup, and `startNewThread()` overwrites that file, but `resumeThread()` never does. After a `/resume`, a supervised restart can still reload the pre-resume thread id, not the thread that was actually resumed.
- Why it matters: this branch explicitly hardens fatal-restart behavior. In that environment, resuming a Codex session is not durable: after a crash/restart the bot can expose the wrong “current” Codex session and silently continue from stale state instead of the session the operator just resumed.
- Concrete fix: call `saveCodexPrefs()` from `resumeThread()` with the resumed `threadId`, `model`, and `reasoningEffort`, the same way `startNewThread()` persists new threads.
- Missing test: extend `src/codex-session.test.ts` to assert that `CODEX_PREFS_FILE.threadId` is updated when `resumeThread()` succeeds.

## Medium

### 2. Telegram can resume live Codex sessions that never received the new bootstrap prompt
- File paths: `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/config.ts`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/codex-session.ts`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/commands.ts`
- Approximate lines: `261-279`, `1095-1106`, `1174-1199`, `1707-1715`, `517-518`
- Issue: the new `CODEX_TELEGRAM_BOOTSTRAP.md` is now a Telegram-only runtime prompt, but `resumeSession()` still allows resuming same-directory live sessions from the app-server list, and `resumeThread()` unconditionally sets `systemPromptPrepended = true`. That suppresses bootstrap injection even when the resumed thread originated outside Telegram and never received those instructions.
- Why it matters: a same-repo Codex CLI session resumed from Telegram can now bypass the Telegram runtime contract entirely on its first post-resume turn. That means SubTurtle spawning/state-file rules can silently disappear exactly in the resume path this change is trying to stabilize.
- Concrete fix: track whether a session was bootstrapped by Telegram (for example via saved-session metadata or transcript artifact detection) and only skip bootstrap on resume when that provenance is present. Otherwise inject the bootstrap prompt on the first Telegram-owned turn after resume.
- Missing test: add a `resumeSession()` case that sources the session from `getSessionListLive()` without transcript bootstrap evidence and assert that the first `sendMessage()` still includes the `<system-instructions>` wrapper.

## Verification

- `bun test src/codex-session.test.ts src/session-observability.test.ts src/dashboard.test.ts`
- Result: `98 pass, 0 fail`
