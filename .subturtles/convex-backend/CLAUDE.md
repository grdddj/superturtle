## Current Task
Create `convex/posts.ts` with `listPosts` query that fetches all posts sorted by createdAt desc, and for each post resolves the author from the users table (returning author displayName, photoURL, title alongside post data).

## End Goal with Specs
Convex backend with:
- `users` table: displayName, photoURL, title, headline, location, about, experience (array of strings), connections (number), followers (number), isFeatured (boolean — true for Tadeáš)
- `posts` table: authorId (reference to users), description (string), fileType (optional string), fileData (optional string), createdAt (number — epoch ms), likesCount (number), commentsCount (number)
- Query functions: `listPosts` (returns posts joined with author data, sorted by createdAt desc), `getUser` (get user by id), `getFeaturedUser` (get the user with isFeatured=true for the profile page)
- Mutation: `seedData` — inserts all mock users and posts if the posts table is empty
- All functions pushed to Convex cloud and working

## Backlog
- [x] Create `convex/schema.ts` with users and posts table definitions as described above
- [x] Create `convex/users.ts` with `getUser` query (by id) and `getFeaturedUser` query (isFeatured === true)
- [ ] Create `convex/posts.ts` with `listPosts` query that fetches all posts sorted by createdAt desc, and for each post resolves the author from the users table (returning author displayName, photoURL, title alongside post data) <- current
- [ ] Create `convex/seed.ts` with a `seedData` mutation that checks if posts table is empty, then inserts 4 users and 9 posts with the exact data below
- [ ] Run `npx convex dev --once` to push functions and verify no errors
- [ ] Commit with message "Add Convex schema, queries, and seed data for Bíbr In"

## Notes
- Convex folder is at `linkedin-demo/convex/` (NOT src/convex)
- The generated types are in `linkedin-demo/convex/_generated/`
- Use `import { query, mutation } from "./_generated/server";` and `import { v } from "convex/values";`
- For the schema, use `import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";`
- CRA uses REACT_APP_ prefix — env is already set in `.env.local`
- Run all commands from the `linkedin-demo/` directory
- The seed mutation should store authorId as a reference: use `Id<"users">` type
- Use `ctx.db.query("posts").collect()` pattern for queries
- Use `ctx.db.insert("users", {...})` for inserts
- After creating schema.ts, run `npx convex dev --once` to push — this validates the schema
