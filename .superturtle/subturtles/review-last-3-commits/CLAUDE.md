# Current task
Review commit `bd2a881f` for bugs, regressions, and missing test coverage.

# End goal with specs
Produce a code review covering the last three commits in this repo. Review exactly these commits: `7dbdb994` (`Fix subturtle board unpin after completion`), `ed35687e` (`Simplify Telegram subturtle board UX`), and `bd2a881f` (`Refactor Codex pending output coordination`). Focus on actionable findings, behavioral regressions, and test gaps. Keep one commit-specific backlog item per commit and track progress in this file as the review advances.
