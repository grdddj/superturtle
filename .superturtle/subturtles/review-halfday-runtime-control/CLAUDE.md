# Current task

Review `super_turtle/bin/superturtle.js` for startup, shutdown, and process ownership regressions.

# End goal with specs

- Deliver a code review focused on bugs, failure modes, lifecycle regressions, and missing coverage.
- Scope the review to the recent runtime/control lane, especially `super_turtle/bin/superturtle.js`, Codex driver and pending-output changes, session/config changes, SubTurtle board lifecycle updates, and related tests.
- Use the last 12 hours of git history as the review window.
- Write findings to `.superturtle/subturtles/review-halfday-runtime-control/review.md`.
- Do not change product code unless the meta agent explicitly asks; this worker is for review only.

# Roadmap (Completed)

- Defined the review lane around runtime lifecycle, Codex pending outputs, and SubTurtle control-plane changes from the last 12 hours.
- Identified the main files touched in this lane from recent git history.

# Roadmap (Upcoming)

- Inspect the relevant commit range and diff hunks in detail.
- Check lifecycle assumptions around start, stop, restart, deferred completion, and board state cleanup.
- Evaluate whether the updated tests cover the risky operational paths.
- Write a concise findings-first review with file and line references.

# Backlog

- [x] Collect the exact commit list and touched files for the runtime/control lane
- [ ] Review `super_turtle/bin/superturtle.js` for startup, shutdown, and process ownership regressions <- current
- [ ] Review Codex driver changes in `src/drivers/` plus `src/codex-session.ts` and `src/config.ts`
- [ ] Review SubTurtle-related changes in `src/subturtle-board-service.ts`, command/callback handling, and lifecycle cleanup
- [ ] Audit the associated tests for missing failure cases and flaky assumptions
- [ ] Write prioritized findings in `review.md` with concrete file references and residual risks
