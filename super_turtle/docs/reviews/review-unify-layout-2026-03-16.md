# Review: unify-superturtle-layout

Date: 2026-03-16
Branch: `unify-superturtle-layout`
Baseline: `main...HEAD` plus local unstaged deletion of `.subturtles/teleport-provider-registry/CLAUDE.md`

## Diff triage

`git diff --stat main...HEAD` reports 111 files changed, with 13,067 insertions and 9,031 deletions.

Highest-risk review order:

1. Hosted cloud CLI and runtime ownership
   Files:
   - `super_turtle/bin/cloud.js` (1,825 lines)
   - `super_turtle/bin/cloud-control-plane-contract.js` (475 lines)
   - `super_turtle/bin/runtime-ownership-agent.js` (195 lines)
   - `super_turtle/tests/cloud-cli.test.js`
   - `super_turtle/tests/cloud-session-durability.test.js`
   - `super_turtle/tests/cloud-session-permission-race.test.js`
   - `super_turtle/tests/cloud-session-read-race.test.js`
   - `super_turtle/tests/cloud-session-size-race.test.js`
   Rationale: this is the largest new behavioral surface, it persists auth/session state on disk, and it introduces lease/ownership logic that can break runtime exclusivity or strand sessions.

2. Telegram ownership handoff and remote runtime gating
   Files:
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/index.ts` (1,170 lines)
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/telegram-transport.ts` (484 lines)
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/teleport.ts` (162 lines)
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/commands.ts`
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/commands.teleport.test.ts`
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/telegram-transport.test.ts`
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/text.remote.test.ts`
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/voice.remote.test.ts`
   Rationale: this path changes how Telegram delivery moves between polling, webhook, standby, and remote control/agent modes. Regressions here can black-hole updates or break `/teleport` and `/home`.

3. Remote webhook bootstrap and E2B runtime orchestration
   Files:
   - `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc-lib.js` (1,309 lines)
   - `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc.js`
   - `super_turtle/e2b-template/*`
   - `super_turtle/tests/e2b-webhook-poc.test.js`
   Rationale: this code provisions the remote sandbox, syncs the repo/auth state, and performs webhook cutover. Failures here are operationally expensive and may not show up in unit-only coverage.

4. Runtime layout migration and config compatibility
   Files:
   - `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/config.ts` (570 lines)
   - `super_turtle/subturtle/lib/env.sh`
   - `super_turtle/setup`
   - `super_turtle/tests/runtime-layout-migration.sh`
   - `.subturtles/teleport-provider-registry/CLAUDE.md` (local deletion)
   Rationale: the branch moves runtime data under `.superturtle/` and performs automatic migration at startup. Compatibility mistakes here can delete or orphan existing user state.

## Review sequence for later passes

- First pass: `super_turtle/bin/cloud.js`, `super_turtle/bin/cloud-control-plane-contract.js`, `super_turtle/bin/runtime-ownership-agent.js`
- Second pass: `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/index.ts`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/telegram-transport.ts`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/teleport.ts`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/config.ts`
- Third pass: touched tests for the new cloud, transport, teleport, and migration behavior
- Final pass: local deletion of `.subturtles/teleport-provider-registry/CLAUDE.md` and final findings write-up

## Findings so far

1. Medium: Claude credential bootstrap can copy the wrong value into the remote runtime.
   - File: `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc-lib.js:221-252`
   - `extractTokenFromCredentialPayload()` walks every string in the parsed credential payload and returns the first non-empty one, regardless of key name.
   - I verified locally that a realistic payload like `{"claudeAiOauth":{"account":{"emailAddress":"user@example.com"},"accessToken":"claude-real-token"}}` resolves to `user@example.com`, not the token.
   - That value is then fed through `discoverClaudeAccessToken()` and `buildRemoteEnv()`, so `/teleport` can seed `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` with an email or username and break remote auth bootstrap.
   - This is a regression relative to the existing token-specific extractors in `super_turtle/bin/superturtle.js:1241-1270` and `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/handlers/commands.ts:1155-1181`.

2. Medium: Healthy sandbox reuse skips auth refresh, so repeat teleports can strand the remote runtime on stale or missing credentials.
   - Files: `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc-lib.js:741-764`, `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc-lib.js:967-1046`, `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc-lib.js:1077-1082`
   - `launchTeleportRuntime()` computes fresh local auth bootstrap data up front, but if the existing sandbox is healthy and `shouldRunFullBootstrap()` returns false, it exits before `persistRemoteProjectEnv()` and `bootstrapRemoteDriverAuth()` run.
   - Because the reuse check only compares runtime version, remote mode, and remote driver, later local credential fixes or token refreshes are never propagated to the reused sandbox.
   - Operational impact: a sandbox created before `codex login`/Claude auth was fixed can remain permanently unusable across fast `/teleport` cycles unless the operator forces a full reprovision.

3. High: Local startup can steal Telegram ownership from an active remote sandbox if the cached teleport state is stale.
   - Files: `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/index.ts:1080-1108`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/telegram-transport.ts:401-405`, `super_turtle/claude-telegram-bot/src/teleport.ts:140-145`, `super_turtle/bin/e2b-webhook-poc-lib.js:1194-1207`
   - The local runtime chooses between polling and standby from `loadTeleportStateForCurrentProject()` before it asks Telegram who currently owns the bot.
   - If that state file says `ownerMode !== "remote"`, startup goes straight into polling mode and `startTelegramTransport()` immediately calls `deleteWebhook({ drop_pending_updates: true })`.
   - The only reconciliation hook exposed through `reconcileTeleportOwnershipForCurrentProject()` repairs the `remote -> local` direction; when cached state is stale in the opposite direction it simply returns the stale local record without querying for or restoring remote ownership.
   - Operational impact: after a crash, manual state edit, or any missed state write on `/teleport`, restarting the local bot can clear the live remote webhook and drop pending updates before the remote sandbox has a chance to continue serving Telegram traffic.
